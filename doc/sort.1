    SORT(1)                     FREEDOS                     SORT(1)


     NAME
          sort - ASCII sort files

     SYNOPSIS
          sort [ sort_options ] [file]

     DESCRIPTION
          Sort is used to sort the input file. Lines of input are
          taken from the file named on the sort command or if no file
          is given, input is taken from standard input.

     OPTIONS
          The following command line options are supported.  The
          options are not case sensitive, so /r is equivalent to /R.

          /r          Sort in reverse order.

          /h          Display a brief help message.

          The notation /+num causes the sort key to begin in column
          num. The first column is 1.

     EXAMPLES
          Sort the contents of file1 using the entire line as the sort
          key.

               Example% sort file1

          or

               Example% sort <file1

          Sort file1 in reverse order (Z-A) based on the key starting
          in column 21.

               Example% sort /R /+21 <file1

          Sort c:\tmp\foobar.dat using the key in column 5 and put the
          output on a file called data.out residing on the B: floppy
          drive.

               Example% sort /+5 c:\tmp\foobar.dat >b:data.out

     BUGS
          This version of sort only uses conventional ram and  does
          not do an out-of-memory sort, so it is limited to what can
          fit in available memory.  The maximum record length is 1000
          characters and the maximum number of records that can be
          sorted is 10,000.  This does not mean that you will be able
          to sort 10,000 records of 1000 characters each, since you
          would run out of memory before you read all of the data in.
